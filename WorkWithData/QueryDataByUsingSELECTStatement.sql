Query data by using SELECT statements
 - Use the ranking function to select top (X) rows for multiple categories in a single query; write and perform
   queries effeciently using the new (SQL 2005/8) oode items such as synonyms, and joins (except, intersect);
   implement logic which uses dynamic SQL and system metadata; write effecient; technically complex SQL queries,
   including all types of joins versus the use of derived tables; determine what code may or may not execute
   based on the tables provided; given a table with constraints, determine which statement set would load
   a table; use and understand different data access technologies; case versus isnull versus coalesce.
